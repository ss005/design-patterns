programs on design patterns

Creational patterns -> 
======================
1. Factory Method : separate a simple logic required for creation of object into a factory method 
2. Abstract Factory : factory of factories  
3. Builder : prevent constructor pollution 
4. Prototype :
5. Singleton : make one and only one object

Structural patterns -> 
======================
6. Adapter : make two  incompatible interfaces compatible 
7. Bridge :
8. Composite :
9. Decorator : decorate the object without going suffering the class explosion 
10. Facade : hide complex sub-system and provide the outer interface to the client 
11. Flyweight :
12. Proxy : rather than providing original class/implementation to the client, provide a proxy class which adds some additional/necessary features to the original class.

Behavirol patterns -> 
=====================
13. Chain of Responsibility :
14. Command :
15. Iterator : iterate through all the elements without knowing the interal implementation 
16. Mediator :
17. Memento :
18. Observer : like subject notifying all its observers whenever its state changes 
19. Visitor :
20. Strategy : make your strategy at run time and pass the required object 
21. State :
22. Template Method :
